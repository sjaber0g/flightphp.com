# HTTP Caching

Flight provides built-in support for HTTP level caching. If the caching condition
is met, Flight will return an HTTP `304 Not Modified` response. The next time the
client requests the same resource, they will be prompted to use their locally
cached version.

## Last-Modified

You can use the `lastModified` method and pass in a UNIX timestamp to set the date
and time a page was last modified. The client will continue to use their cache until
the last modified value is changed.

``` php?start_inline=1
Flight::route('/news', function(){
    Flight::lastModified(1234567890);
    echo 'This content will be cached.';
});
```

## ETag

`ETag` caching is similar to `Last-Modified`, except you can specify any id you
want for the resource:

``` php?start_inline=1
Flight::route('/news', function(){
    Flight::etag('my-unique-id');
    echo 'This content will be cached.';
});
```

Keep in mind that calling either `lastModified` or `etag` will both set and check the
cache value. If the cache value is the same between requests, Flight will immediately
send an `HTTP 304` response and stop processing.
